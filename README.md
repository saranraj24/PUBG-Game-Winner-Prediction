# Data Wrangling
Data wrangling is crucial for preparing the dataset for machine learning. Tasks include:

## Removing unnecessary columns
- Handling missing values (e.g., dropping rows)
- Converting categorical data to numerical form (e.g., using one-hot encoding)
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- These steps ensure that the data is in a suitable format for training machine learning models.

# Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance. For the PUBG win prediction model, this might include:
- Normalizing features
- Dropping irrelevant features to reduce model complexity
